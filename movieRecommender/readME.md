# Basic Movie Recommender system in python

Takeaways from this small project:

1) Cosine Similarity

Cosine Similarity is a measurement that quantifies the similarity between two or more vectors, commonly used as a similarity measurement technique.

It is one method of quantifying the similarity between two or more objects and building recommender systems. From the world of computer vision to data mining, there is lots of usefulness to comparing a similarity measurement between two vectors represented in a higher-dimensional space.

In this small movie recommender project, quantification of the similarity between two movies can be obtained by converting the words or phrases within the titles, actors and or directors into a vectorised form of representation.

The vector representations of the titles,actors and or directors can then be used within the cosine similarity formula to obtain a quantification of similarity

In the python notebook, I can see that cosine similarity of 1 implies that the two movies are exactly alike and a cosine similarity of 0 would point to the conclusion that there are no similarities between the two movies.

**Conclusion**
In e-Commerce domain, cosine similarity could be used for identifying the best similar products for recommendation to a user for a E-commerce website.
